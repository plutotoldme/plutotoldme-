  <h1>Who Are You in Love?</h1>
  <p>This beginner's Venus guide explores your relationship style and potential Venusian qualities.
Venus isn’t just about romance.
Let me introduce you to the brightest celestial body in our night sky—the planet of roses, softness, and magnetic pull. She rules both Taurus and Libra. She’s all about beauty, pleasure, and connection.
Venus shows us:
♀ What you find beautiful and pleasurable
♀ How you express affection and connection
♀ Where you seek harmony—whether in relationships, environments, or self-worth
♀ Your values around money, self-worth, and aesthetics
She rules what you’re drawn to. How you attract. What you chase (and what you refuse to).
She knows your beauty, your boundaries, your sensuality and your patterns.
It’s not just about who you love. It’s about how you let yourself be loved.
She influences the way you love your friends, flirt with strangers, style your home, curate your closet, and even stand up for what you value.
In astrology, Venus brings warmth and sweetness to any planet she touches. Even her hard aspects (like squares and oppositions) still bring more ease and charm than silence.
Some even believe the Star of Bethlehem—the guiding light to Jesus—was Venus shining at dawn. What better planet to represent the path to divine love?
So what does your Venus say about your love style?
Let’s break it down by element:
♀ Fire Venus / House (1H, 5H, 9H)
You crave passion and play. You love the thrill of pursuit and light up when things feel fresh, wild, and fun.
♀ Earth Venus / House (2H, 6H, 10H)
You value loyalty, stability, and the tangible side of love. Acts of service, steady affection, and grounded comfort win your heart.
♀ Air Venus / House (3H, 7H, 11H)
You fall in love with minds first. Intellectual connection, shared ideas, and witty banter are your love language.
♀ Water Venus / House (4H, 8H, 12H)
You dive deep. You value emotional intimacy, energetic safety, and soul-deep bonds that transcend the surface.
Are you Venusian?
You might be, if you have:
♀ A Taurus or Libra Sun, Moon, or Rising
♀ Personal planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars) in Taurus or Libra
♀ Personal planets in your 2nd or 7th House
♀ Venus aspects to your person planets
These same rules apply to how harmonious your connection is in synastry.
Taurus/2H is sensual Venus—soft lighting, luxury fabrics, indulgent meals, touch.
Libra/7H is relational Venus—beauty through balance, grace, and partnership.
Do you have Venus Retrograde?
This is rare, karmic, and powerful.Venus only retrogrades every 18 months and stays there briefly—making this placement significant.
Those born under a retrograde Venus often feel love differently. You might question your self-worth or struggle to trust others’ affections.
You may walk a longer road toward healthy connection—but once you do, you’ll have cultivated a love that’s deeply conscious and beautifully earned.
You are here to rewrite love scripts, starting with your own.
