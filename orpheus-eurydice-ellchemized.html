  <h1>Orpheus & Eurydice — Ellchemized</h1>

  <img class="visual" src="https://i.imgur.com/DUKpAiW.jpeg" alt="Orpheus and Eurydice inspired visual" />

  <p>Have you ever felt you’re on the brink of everything you’ve ever wanted?<br>
  But one wrong move could ruin it all?</p>

  <p>Like the last step forward requires full faith? Faith that doesn’t give proof, doesn’t reassure, doesn’t soothe your doubt?</p>

  <p>The kind of faith that feels so out of reach, you just blast your emo playlist and carry on imagining everything that could have been?</p>

  <p>Let’s talk about Orpheus and Eurydice. Ellchemized.</p>

  <p>Orpheus was basically a music icon in Greek mythology. His songs had the entire world vibing. Animals stopped mid-zoomies. The trees leaned in to listen. Even the siren songs sounded mid af when Orpheus hopped on a beat.</p>

  <p>He meets a wood nymph named Eurydice, twin flame vibes immediately. He’s ready to cuff, even while bad omens of their union are whispered among the very altar where they share their vows.</p>

  <p>One day Eurydice is walking in the forest, literally minding her business, and bro’s weird friend Aristaeus tries to hit.</p>

  <p>She says, “Absolutely not,” and power walks home to block him on every realm. She rustles some leaves, startles a snake, and gets bit. Lethally.</p>

  <p>Orpheus is wrecked. His music went from setting the vibe to absolutely killing it.</p>

  <p>Eventually he remembers who tf he is. Son of Apollo. Sad-boy supreme. “Nah, I’m getting my girl.”</p>

  <p>He asks Zeus for the underworld wifi. Zeus says, “I don’t want that smoke. Sorry bro, that’s Hades’ jurisdiction.”</p>

  <p>Orpheus says, “Bet.” Hermes clocks the tea and ties his sandals.</p>

  <p>Orpheus and Hermes descend to the underworld to save Eurydice from signing a lease in The Land of the Dead.</p>

  <p>Hermes is like, “This is a bad idea.” Orpheus goes, “Peep this.” He gets his lyre and drops a melody.</p>

  <p>The underworld stops. Cerberus lays down. Sisyphus stops pushing his rock. Tantalus reaches for the forbidden waters. Charon says, “Hop in. No fare today.”</p>

  <p>They pull up to Hades’ lair. He is PISSED. But Orpheus keeps playing. The furies weep. Persephone is moved. Hades sheds a single iron tear.</p>

  <p>“Okay,” Hades says. “Eurydice can return with you. But I can’t look soft. You gotta walk in faith. If you turn around looking for her, she stays here. Forever.”</p>

  <p>Orpheus is down for whatever it takes. Him & Eurydice are climbing their way out of hell.</p>

  <p>But… he can’t see if she is following him. He can’t hear her footsteps. What if she can’t keep up? What if she got sidetracked by a cool rock? Is she even back there?</p>

  <p>The closer to sunlight they get, the more he spirals.</p>

  <p>He can see the sky. The clouds. He can hear the birds. But not her. No footsteps. No breath. Just doubt.</p>

  <p>He’s crashing out. He breaks. “Fuck it, how will they know?” He turns around.</p>

  <p>She’s right there. Being dragged back to Hell. He tried to reach back for her, to save her from being pulled under. But she was no longer in his grasp.</p>

  <p>Her second chance at life? Gone. His second chance at love? Vanished.</p>

  <p>Orpheus returns devastated. He tries to go back a second time, but Hermes stops him. “Don’t do it, bro. You’ll make it worse. For her and for you.”</p>

  <p>He spent the rest of his days sitting in a grove of trees, playing music of heartache, heartbreak, and a longing that never gives. He never escapes the memory of the time he almost had it all.</p>
