  <h1>Orpheus & Eurydice</h1>
  <h2>Ellchemized</h2>

  <p>Have you ever felt you’re on the brink of everything you’ve ever wanted?<br>
  But one wrong move could ruin it all?</p>

  <p>Like the last step forward requires full faith? Faith that doesn’t give proof, doesn’t reassure, doesn’t sooth your doubt?</p>

  <p>The kind of faith that feels so out of reach, you just blast your emo playlist and carry on imagining everything that could have been?</p>

  <p>Let’s talk about Orpheus and Eurydice. Ellchemized.</p>

  <p>Orpheus was basically a music icon in Greek mythology.<br>
  His songs had the entire world vibing.<br>
  Animals stopped mid-zoomies.<br>
  The trees leaned in to listen.<br>
  Even the siren songs sounded mid af when Orpheus hopped on a beat.</p>

  <p>He meets a wood nymph named Eurydice, twin flame vibes immediately.<br>
  He’s ready to cuff, even while bad omens of their union are whispered among the very alter where they share their vows.</p>

  <p>One day Eurydice is walking in the forest, literally minding her business, and bro’s weird friend Aristaeus tries to hit.</p>

  <p>She says, “Absolutely not,” and power walks home to block him on every realm.</p>

  <p>She rustles some leaves, startles a snake, and gets bit. Lethally.</p>

  <p>Orpheus is wrecked. His music went from setting the vibe to absolutely killing it.</p>

  <p>Eventually he remembers who tf he is.<br>
  Son of Apollo. Sad-boy supreme.<br>
  “Nah, I’m getting my girl.”</p>

  <p>He asks Zeus for the underworld wifi.<br>
  Zeus says, “I don’t want that smoke. Sorry bro, that’s Hades’ jurisdiction.”</p>

  <p>Orpheus says, “Bet.”<br>
  Hermes clocks the tea and ties his sandals.</p>

  <p>Orpheus and Hermes descend to the underworld to save Eurydice from signing a lease in The Land of the Dead.</p>

  <p>Hermes is like, “This is a bad idea.”<br>
  Orpheus goes, “Peep this.”<br>
  He gets his lyre and drops a melody.</p>

  <p>The underworld stops.</p>

  <p>Cerberus lays down.<br>
  Sisyphus stops pushing his rock.<br>
  Tantalus reaches for the forbidden waters.<br>
  Charon said, “Hop in. No fare today.”</p>

  <p>They pull up to Hades’ lair.<br>
  He is PISSED.</p>

  <p>But Orpheus keeps playing.<br>
  The furies weep.<br>
  Persephone is moved.<br>
  Hades sheds a single iron tear.</p>

  <p>“Okay,” Hades says.<br>
  “Eurydice can return with you. But I can’t look soft.<br>
  You gotta walk in faith. If you turn around looking for her, she stays here. Forever.”</p>

  <p>Orpheus is down for whatever it takes.</p>

  <p>Him & Eurydice are climbing their way out of hell.</p>

  <p>But… he can’t see if she is following him.<br>
  He can’t hear her footsteps.<br>
  What if she can’t keep up?<br>
  What if she got sidetracked by a cool rock?<br>
  Is she even back there?</p>

  <p>The closer to sunlight they get, the more he spirals.</p>

  <p>He can see the sky. The clouds.<br>
  He can hear the birds.<br>
  But not her.<br>
  No footsteps. No breath.<br>
  Just doubt.</p>

  <p>He’s crashing out.<br>
  He breaks.<br>
  “Fuck it, how will they know?”</p>

  <p>He turns around.</p>

  <p>She’s right there.<br>
  Being dragged back to Hell.</p>

  <p>He tried to reach back for her, to save her from being pulled under.<br>
  But she was no longer in his grasp.</p>

  <p>Her second chance at life? Gone.<br>
  His second chance at love? Vanished.</p>

  <p>Orpheus returns devastated.<br>
  He tries to go back a second time, but Hermes stops him.<br>
  “Don’t do it, bro. You’ll make it worse. For her and for you.”</p>

  <p>He spent the rest of his days sitting in a grove of trees,<br>
  playing music of heartache, heartbreak, and a longing that never gives.<br>
  He never escapes the memory of the time he almost had it all.</p>
