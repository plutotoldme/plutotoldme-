  <pre>
It's Ellchemy
Still humble 
Yeah

Ellie Moore LaFlare (iykyk)
Alchemist but don‚Äôt give no care
Tote my magic anywhere
Go to spiritual war, I don‚Äôt care 
Burn yo' psyche, heal yo' wounds in there
Called the guides, I had intention there
Intuition and my vision there
Drop truth bombs, it‚Äôs cause I care (Go!)
Your girl never had validation
So I gave her a share
Really, it‚Äôs not an affair
'Cause she my girl & I care (Huh)
Hot energy, with a coolant, fool
These goofy goobers with bullet wounds
Magic hanging out my britches
You can see this from a distance
I got guides and angels with thirty clips
Fresh-ass bitch with a spirit pistol
I‚Äôm the same girl that fixed yo' sister
You so stuck, can‚Äôt get no pistol (Damn)
I‚Äôll heal yo' bitch, I‚Äôll heal yo' life
Don‚Äôt no one but yo mama recognize you (Wow)
Every day, I‚Äôm on drive, ready
Never catch me in neutral
I ain‚Äôt doin' nothing in reverse
I wear my wounds, not avoidance
This concert is my convert
Got the right plan but the wrong person
I got space to hold, I got room to hold
I got sweetness like Starburst (Brr!)
I don‚Äôt rehearse, I don‚Äôt plan first
I need a strong hook, I call into spirit

Baddies here, soul bared 
If the energy wack, eject it
Man, all my hoes be actin' like alchemists
But I don‚Äôt give a fuck and if I did, I wouldn‚Äôt give it to you
That spirit has two messages, wisdom and truth, yeah
I just sold Father Time a time zone
They say we runnin' out of time
Tell that to a time bomb, yeah
Then she kiss me on my bullet wound
Who are you? 'Cause motherfucker, I‚Äôm me, fuckin' right
And if she say she catching a vibe, I throw a strike
I can‚Äôt believe this alchemy, go get my journal, write
Hex a hater twice in case he live a double life
Lil Ellie, yeah

Shawty giving love, the spirit dripping love
I live a double life, I am stupid dumb wise (Dumb wise)
I do the shit that therapists do without a formal education (Nah)
I shit on hate & pour up fate, I got karmic respect (karmic)
I hit you with that mirror, you won‚Äôt live a double life (Nah)
I hit two reflections last week
So I got double stripes (I got double stripes)
Foreign soul lesson, yeah it get perceived on sight (Yeah)
I got wisdom, intuition, I got life on top of life
